 * before this one wanted a bare position on one side and a written value or a bare position on the
 * other. What decides which quantity a rule cuts is this form and never the spelling, so
 * {@code a > b}, {@code a + 0 > b} and {@code a > b + 0} are one rule about one quantity.

 * <p>The constant is moved to the threshold rather than kept in the quantity. {@code a + 1 <= 10} is
 * {@code a <= 9} and {@code 2 * a <= 9} is {@code 2 * a <= 9}, so a quantity is constant-free and a
 * threshold is a number. Left in the quantity, the values {@code 2 * a} takes would be the even
 * numbers under one spelling and the odd ones shifted by nine under another, and the two would
 * disagree about where the border's points are.
